    "   I think this problem can be generalized to all $Ax=b$ problems. When A satisfies some certain conditions (such as H given in this question), this system of equations can have more than one, even infinite solutions. When we only consider a single solution, for example, the smallest l1- In norm, only one set of solutions can be obtained. In this question, it is more like the basis of other solutions, which can span to other solutions. And there are more solutions that are linear combinations of the solutions we get, so we cannot get the correct answers in 2 bit and 3 bit problems. "
